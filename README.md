  Unifier</h1>
<p align=center>A sophisticated Discord bot uniting servers and platforms, brought to you by Green and ItsAsheer<br>
Inspired by matrix-t2bot</p>

## What is Unifier?
Unifier is a bot written in Python which allows users to connect their Discord servers together to form one big chat room. 
It is also compatible with Revolt and Guilded with support extensions, meaning that it can also be used as a bridge bot to 
connect servers from different platforms together.

## Features
### Basic features
Like most bridge bots, Unifier has basic commands such as link, unlink, etc., so you can do most of what you'd need to do 
all on your messaging app of choice.

### Fast and responsive bridge
Using threading and optimizations, Unifier is able to bridge messages at speeds up to 20.3 messages a second, so nobody needs 
to wait to see your message.

### Revolt and Guilded support
With [Revolt](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/unifier-revolt) and [Guilded](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/unifier-guilded) 
support extensions, you can bring your communities outside of Discord together, or get a break from Discord without losing 
your community.

### Moderation commands
After you assign bot admins, they can assign moderators, who can help moderate the chat and take action against bad actors. 
Server moderators can also block members and servers from bridging messages to their servers should they find it necessary.

### And more!
- **Message cache backups**: Unifier's message cache is backed up on graceful shutdowns, so it remembers message IDs between
reboots for replying, editing, and deleting.
- **Message reporting**: Users can report messages to Unifier moderators, so they can more easily take action against bad
actors.
- **Database-free**: No need to get a database up and running. Everything is stored locally on the same system you use to run 
Unifier, so the performance is not impacted by slow 10k+ ping database servers.
- **External bridge support**: Unifier supports external bridge services like [matrix-t2bot](https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-appservice-discord), 
so you can connect platforms beyond what we can cover and avoid reconfiguring too much.
